+ Ardrahan – a semi-soft cheese from County Cork. Sample with Southwark made Brew By Numbers 05/01*
+ Amarelo – Portuguese goat and sheep`s milk cheese. A chilled tawny port should be superb
+ Asiago – Italian cow`s milk cheese. Try with an Italian Chardonnay or for a red a Bardolino or Valpolicella Classico. Try a decent Soave with younger, softer asiago or an off-dry Processco with an aged version.
+ Azeitao – A Sheep`s milk cheese from just South of Lisbon. Try with a Portuguese red wine, Tempranillo or Moscatel.
+ Baby Bel – a Beaujolais.
+ BallyOak – Pinot Blanc for a white, or Pinot Noir for Red. A Irish Cheese

+ Blue Castello – A Danish soft cheese, try with Sauvignon Blanc
+ Bougon – A goat`s milk Camembert. See Goats Cheese.
+ Boursin – A fresh and tangy Sauvignon from New Zealand or the Loire or an Entre Deux Mers. Perhaps also a Gewurztraminer.
+ Boucheron – See Goats Cheese.
+ Brendon – A strong matured goats cheese from Exmoor. Semi soft with a dense texture and sweet aftertaste.
+ Brie/Camembert – A difficult one as the classical tang of ammonia often jars nastily with wine. Try a red from the South of France – Fitou or Corbieres. An LBV port is also worth trying. Champagne works as would other dry sparkling wines.
+ Brillat Savarin – red Bordeaux.
+ Burrata – rosé Champagne.
+ Buxton Blue – A cousin of Blue Stilton.
+ Cabrales – a dry or sweet Sherry for this Spanish blue cheese or a sweet wine.
+ Caciocavallo – god with southern Italian reds such as Negroamaro or Nero d’Avola
+ Caerphilly – Could I suggest a crisp dry English wine with this hard cheese. Or try an Albarinho (Portuguese white), a Spanish Red, a Zinfandel or Sauvignon Blanc.
+ Cambembert – at its best when the centre is still hard while the outer is creamy. Quite salty. Go for a red wine here – Cotes d`Castillon or other aged Bordeaux reds. A new world Pinot Noir would also suit. Also consider a Greco di Tufo.
+ Cantabria – a Spanish cheese so go for a young, fruity Spanish red.
+ Capricorn – A soft goats cheese from Somerset.
+ Castelmagno – a Barolo, Barbaresco or Amarone.
+ Celtic Promise – A semihard cheese with a rich savoury taste, made in Wales and matured with Cider in Surrey so obviously a cider with this one.
+ Chaource – a Chablis or Blanc de Noirs champagne.
+ Cheddar – Buy the best you can afford and revel in the flavour combinations with a Sauvignon Blanc for a white or a good claret, Rhone, or Rhone styled wine from California or Australia. Zinfandel is great too. An Argentinian Bonarda makes a tasty, affordable alternative. Try an apple juice for something non-alcoholic. Classically serve a decent ale for a true British taste sensation. “Barolo is a dream combo for me“. Also suggested is a sweet Australian Riesling (Horrocks Cordon Cut Riesling).
+ Cheshire – Again a Sauvignon Blanc would be my first choice, a Riesling the second but for a red consider a Cabernet based wine from the New World.
+ Chèvre Brie – A goats cheese brie. See either category.
+ Cimbro – Cow`s milk cheese from north of Verona, Italy. Amarone della Valpolicella Classico is the wine to try.
+ Colby – red Bordeaux, Champagne, Riesling.
+ Comte – Grüner Veltliner or a Pinot Noir for a red. Jura whites also, as from the same region.
+ Coulommiers – a small deep brie with a sweetness rather than a saltiness to the taste. Try a New Zealand Pinot Noir or a Cotes du Rhone.
+ Cornish Yarg – at once creamy and crumbly with a tang, go for a good ale.
+ Cotija – a Mexican aged cow’s milk cheese. Go for a Chardonnay or Riesling.
+ Crottin de Chavignol – a strong goat`s cheese from Burgundy. Dry and salty with a sweet and sour taste. Try with a Mersault or a Sauvignon Blanc.
+ Danish Blue – Sauternes is a good match as are other sweet wines.
+ Delice de Bourgogne – a triple cream cow’s milk cheese just perfect with a French Chardonnay (Chablis or southern Burgundy)
+ Derby – similar in taste and texture to Cheddar. Go for the fruit juice of a decent Shiraz. For a white try a Chenin Blanc.
+ Double Gloucester – A good quality tawny port makes a good airing also look at Montepulciano d`Abruzzo or a Riesling.
+ Edam – Any Cabernet or Merlot based wine from Bordeaux and surrounds works very well. Try a Riesling for a white.
+ Elmhirst – a triple cream mould ripened cheese similar to Vignotte. Light texture and delicate flavour when young. Here a light
+ Italian white wine would be good.
+ Emmental – Sauvignon Blanc again goes very well try also a Californian Zinfandel or from Italy a Primitivo. Beaujolais and Côtes du Rhône are also recommended.
+ Epoisses – Napoleon’s favourite. Strong in flavour and aroma, this classic cheese from Burgundy should be matched with a wine from the same region – a white of course, a Chablis preferably. I’ve also seen recommendations for matching with Gewurztraminer. Epoisses is washed in Marc and therefore matches well with Marc de Bourgogne.
+ Evora – From East of Lisbon, Portugal. Sheep`s milk cheese. If you can find it drink a local wine Vila Santa.
+ Feta – the soft cheese from Greece. A full dry wine such as an Alsace Riesling or a red Beaujolias. If oven baked or grilled try with new style Retsina, or whites made from Malagousia and/or Assyrtiko.
+ Fontina – a semi-soft Italian cheese. A Gewurztraminer is superb or try a Gattinara. A crisp Italian white such as Pinot Grigio, Gavi or Vernaccia di San Gimignano too or for a red a Barbaresco, Barolo or Dolcetto.
+ Gaperon – from the Auvergne region of France containing garlic and ground pepper. Comes in a distinctive dome shape with a hard dry rind. A light red for this one – Beaujolais.
+ Gloucester – Pinot Noir or Zinfandel.
+ Goats Cheese – A catch all category for so many different cheeses – to match try a good Rhone Red or a Sauvignon Blanc. Classic taste combinations. Also perhaps an Italian Trebbiano. Greek Goats cheese should be matched with white Roditis or Assyrtiko.
+ Gorgonzola – A sweet wine is needed here. Look into getting a German or Austrian Trockenbeerenauslese or a Hungarian Tokaji. Sauternes is also good.
+ Gouda – a semi-hard cheese from Holland. Definitely red wine country here try a new World Merlot or Zinfandel. Also recommended with Amarone by Wine90.
+ Graddost – a semi-hard cheese from Sweden. Try with a good Chenin Blanc or Sauvignon Blanc.
+ Gruyère – Again a Sauvignon Blanc or for a red wine an Australian Shiraz, a New World Sangiovese or a Chianti. Champagne especially vintage or Blanc de Blancs is also recommended. Gewürztraminer for a white. A Pinot Noir has also been suggested.
+ Havarti – A semi-soft cheese from Denmark. A red Bordeaux or Rioja would be good. For a white try a Chardonnay or Sauvignon Blanc.
+ Jarlsberg – a hard cheese from Norway. A Merlot or Zinfandel here I feel.
+ Kefalotyri – Greek cheese often fried and served as meze dish. Try with Xinomavro Rose or white Roditis.
+ Lancashire – Superb with a tawny port or a Sauternes/Barsac. Try a Sauvignon or better I think a Chianti.
+ Le Chevrot – A superb goats cheese. See Goats Cheese.
+ Livarot – a very strong tasting cheese from Normandy with a heavy moist texture. Chardonnay or a Pinot Gris or an Alsace Gewürztraminer.
+ Lincolnshire Poacher – a raw-milk hard cheese from the Lincolnshire Wolds. Try with Belgian Fantome Saison beer*

+ Manchego – A Spanish red – Garnacha perhaps – for this Spanish cheese or open that aging claret. A Cava is recommended for a young cheese or a Fino or Amontillado Sherry.
+ Maroilles – a soft but powerful French cheese with a very powerful aroma. Perhaps too overpowering for wine but try with an Alsatian Pinot Gris or a Châteauneuf-du-Pape.
+ Mimolette – Cahors or Saint Emilion or other Bordeaux Red.
+ Muddles Green – A Camembert style goats cheese named after the village in which it is made.
+ Munster – Try a Gewürztraminer from Alsace or a cheaper version from Chile or New Zealand if you can find one.
+ Montasio – A cows’ milk cheese from the Italian region of Friuli-Venezia-Guiulia; go for a local white either a Chardonnay Colli Orientali, Pinot Bianco, Friulano Collio or Ribolla Gialla.
+ Monterey Jack – An American semi-hard Cheese best with Rieslings or Californian Chardonnay. For a red try with Zinfandel or Cabernet Sauvignon.
+ Monte Veronese – for a ‘match made in heaven‘ go for a Valpolicella.
+ Morbier – This is a mild cheese made in two sections with a thin charcoal layer between. Worked very well with an unoaked Chardonnay. Try also with a decent Fleurie or other Beaujolais. Arbois white or red.
+ Mozzarella – Do people eat this on its own? Try with a crisp white like a Cotes du Duras or Bergerac or a Beaujolais or an Old Vines Zinfandel for a red.
+ Neufchatel – from the north of Normandy. A smooth texture with a core of crumbly, dryer cheese. Go for a good quality red Loire – a Chinon for example.
+ Old Chatham Ewe’s Blue – recommended with a full-bloodied American Zinfandel.
+ Ossau-Iraty – from the Pays Basque region of France. Try with Bordeaux or Rhone reds.
+ Parmesan – If eaten on its own try with a Spanish Cava, an Amarone or a Super Tuscan wine.
+ Parmigiano-Reggiano – superb with a Gutturino, an Italian blend of Barbera and Bonarda.
+ Pecorino – Great with a rich Zinfandel or try with a full Italian red, an Amarone (a traditional match), Chianti Classico or Brunello. For white wines keep it Italian with Gavi, decent Pinot Grigio or Sauvignon Blanc.
+ Perl Las – ‘blue perl’ a blue-veined Caerphilly made in Carmarthenshire. Try with a beer specifically designed to accompany it: Celt Ogham Ash an Imperial Stout*

+ Picos de Europa – Northern Spanish cheese try with high Acidity/high tannin red wine, Italian Primativo, Zinfandel or certain Merlots.
+ Pont l'Eveque – White Bordeaux, Chardonnay from anywhere or try a white Rioja. For a red try with a red Burgundy.
+ Port Salut – A good quality Cotes du Rhone or similar blend works well as does a lighter style Italian red such as a Bardolino.
+ Provolone – Dolcetto, in a word! or for a white Pinot Bianco, Soave Classico or decent Pinot Grigio.
+ Raclette – A hard French Cheese best with a Beaujolais or a Sauvignon Blanc.
+ Reblochon – A mountain cheese from the Savoie. A thin orange rind, a smooth fatty texture and a nutty aftertaste. Try with a fino sherry or if you can find one a Vin Jaune. A lighter styled Pinot Noir for a red.
+ Red Leicester – Pick a nice Rioja or a full and rich Australian Shiraz. Very good with an ale.
+ Robiolina – Italian cheese/Italian wine – a white, Falanghina or Gavi, Verdicchio or Tocai Friulano.
+ Roquefort & Stilton – The classic combination is with a Sauternes, but try also with any botrytis affected wine (Australian Semillon for example), a sweet Jurancon or cheaper sweet wines from anywhere really. Aged tawny port is also delicious. Vintage Port is wasted on it though.
+ Rosary Ash – An English Goats cheese from Salisbury, rich, fresh with a hint of lemon.
+ Saint Andrews – A supple creamy textured Scottish cheese. Went very well with a Bordeaux white (Sauvignon-Semillon blend) although a straight Sauvignon Blanc would be just as good.

+ Smoked Greek Cheese – various local cheeses in Greece are smoked, try with new style Retsina, Assyrtiko, Greek oak aged Sauvignon Blanc (Fume) or white Malagousia.
+ Soumaintrain – a glorious cheese from Burgundy a must-try with the richer styles of Chablis such as Vieilles Vignes, Chablis with some oak or Chablis with some age to it

+ Taleggio – a full-fat soft cheese from Lombardy, Italy. An Italian white wine (Pinot Bianco, Pinot Grigio, Arneis) would be superb or try with a Chianti Riserva. Traditionally matched with Barbaresco. The lighter style of Pinot Noirs are also worth trying.
+ Toma – Italian cheese with geographic designation such as di Lanzo or Piemontese. Suits Pinot Grigio and Gavi
+ Tornegus – a farm house Caerphilly.
+ Vacherin – a Blanc de Blanc Champagne, an Alsatian Rielsing or a red Beaujolais.
+ Vermont – Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, Syrah or an off-dry Riesling are suggested.
+ Vignotte – a triple cream cheese from the Champagne region. Mild soft texture. A St.Emilion is great.
